Codebook
========

Sample algorithms for commong problems appearing in programming contests that we have gathered
over the years. Algorithms are implemented as header files seperately and included in the
main TeX document.

Algorithms
----------
Each algorithm is equipped with informational header including:
 * input parameters
 * output result
 * time complexity
 * memory complexity
 * unit tests
 * proof of field testing (link to the task solved)
 * additional notes
 * implementation in C++ (at least)
